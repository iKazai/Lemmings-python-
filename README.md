# Lemmings-python-
I just started coding, i need help to build the Lemmings game in python without pygame. I'm a script kiddie.

At school, we started the Object-Oriented Programming and the first homework is the Lemming game in python without using the Pygame lib.

If you have any upgrade, post it pls.
